when you boot the game, before you play a game, you can play records,
every song that you ends it leaves a Record text in the song folder. So you have to rename it to Record.txt,
after you do that, open the game and select the song that you want to replay (without Autoplay),
if you select a song that doesnt have a record, you have to reopen the game to see a record
