changed chart & midi note output to return notes, startpowers, and solos
now starpowers and solos will show in the score accuracy & performance graph
fixed starpower pointer being 1 pixel up
fixed that nightcore mode could be activated in game
in debug mode, keypad minus will finish the song

i didnt implement the solo scoring bc i couldnt find anything that explains it in detail
