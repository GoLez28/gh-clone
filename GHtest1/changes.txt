Added Resources
fixed texture and sound loading to allow loading by resources
Update time of Song.GetTime() at the start of the update to avoid loading the position everytime
update sparks particles every render, besides every update
added logs for most of the try {} (bc why not)

(also i notice the games runs slower, maybe is my pc dying)
