added score and life to vocals
	(i didnt find much about, but this is my approach)
	(didnt add streak/combos yet, should i?)
Score:
	the fill meter is divided into 5 levels
	percentScore = level * 200
	addScore = fillInMillis / 4
	score += (addScore + percentScore) * modMult
Life:
	life += (level - 2) * 0.05f;

reset fills for vocals
avoid player updating when fillTarget == 0
