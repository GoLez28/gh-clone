i tried to optimized the way text is rendered
because it uses too much resources
so i tried rendering with a VBO
but turns out its slower doing it that way
so i wonder, 
what if every image is drawed without VBO
will it be faster?
i searched and it was because of the GPU brand
Nvidias were faster with vertex than AMD, huh...
