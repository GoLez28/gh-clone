moved text methods & variables to Text.cs
create TextFont class to be able to have more font
	(all font are stored in a texture array, with this it can have more)
added font mipmapping
	(isnt really "real" mipmapping, also only has 2 levels)
reduced fixed texture array from 0-512 to 28-126
added fonts to resources

(also the buttons arent in the font, is in a different array, 
but since ascii from 0 to 28 isnt used for text, i use that to point for the button textures)
