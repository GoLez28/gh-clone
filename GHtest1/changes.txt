added microphone detection
	(it can tell the frequencies)
added vocals instrument
	(check controlls screen to enable it)
seperated Draw.cs in multiples files
	(to differenciate between guitar (Fret5), hud, and other instruments, (vocals))
separated Gameplay.cs and GameInput.cs to different files
	(same as the draw)
found out that Bass.BASS_ChannelSetLink() can syncronize streams
	(previously the problem was that playing the streams one by one
	takes time, and will offset the streams, and songs like soulless, it can distort,
	so now it will start at the same time, (still has a little difference but its nothing))
	(i guess bassmix wasnt the solution after all))
now midi can read vocals
	(the vocals its still experimental, if you want to "play", set nofail on)
fixed highway going beyond when paused (it was fun :'( )
fixed pause menu not showing when highway animation is happening

(Most of the files is named Methods.cs because i am bad at naming xD)
(Since i changed the names everything changed too)
