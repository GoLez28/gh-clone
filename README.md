The purpose of this game, change the gameplay and be a game different from clone hero
so what i have planned is to add mods (just like osu!) like hidden notes, or a pressision mode.
The other this is that I want to have custom skins on the game. And many more!

regarding the code, this is my first proyect i do, so i am a noob to the world of programing so i the code is a mess
