The purpose of this game, change the gameplay and be a game different from clone hero
so what i have planned is to add mods (just like osu!) like hidden notes, or a pressision mode.
The other this is that I want to have custom skins on the game. And many more!

If you want to put some skins just in the Skins folder and set the new textures

regarding the code, this is my first proyect i do, so i am a noob to the world of programing so the code is a mess
